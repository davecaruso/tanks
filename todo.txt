Thinkings

- to what scale do i want this on: small project, full game? I THINK MEDIUM GAME
- GFX: do i want a more fancy lighting system.
- new sprites? music? better menu?
- more gamemodes?
- sprite stacking 3d looked super cool i wanna try it out.

Finish items in the todo list, doesnt have to be in order, but
going downwards is generally the right order
